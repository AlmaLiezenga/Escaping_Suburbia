# Code Overview for my master thesis

Late June 2022 I submitted my master thesis 'Escaping Suburbia: A Case Study on Microtransit and Access Equity in the Minneapolis-St.Paul Metropolitan Area' in partial fulfillment of the degree Engineering & Policy Analysis at TU Delft, The Netherlands. For this thesis I used Python, Jython and Excel quite extensively. I have chosen to not share all my code on GitHub since some if it is privacy-sensitive, boring, and/or not really applicable to any other purposes. But a few segments seemed crucial to share out of transparency reasons and also to help others who might be using the same software. 

This repository contains the following folders with described contents: 
* 'Trip_Planning' contains all files required to build a graph with OTP 1.3 Technique for extracting travel time both for access levels and for individual origin destination pairs, along with an explanation of how to use OpenTripPlanner 1.3 for this purpose. 
* 'Accessibility_Analysis' contains scripts that convert the .csv output of the trip planning efforts to cumulative accessibility scores and contains a dummy Excel file showing how you can create a Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient from that data. 

If you have specific questions about the code and how to implement it feel free to drop me a question, always willing to help out and/or provide clarity. The full thesis pdf can be found here: https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/search/?collection=education
